# profanity-filter

## What it does
Change bad words into good words

Heavily based on a comment on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3531746/what-s-a-good-python-profanity-filter-library)

The list of bad words can be changes, the good words that replace them as well

## Example
Change : "This sucks" into "This chocolate"

## Improvements:
Map some bad words with relevant good word. Instead of changin "This sucks" into "This chocolate", it would say "This is inconvenient"
